Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It's the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they're running a 50-person engineering org.

### Marketplace Installation

Install from the Claude Code marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add glittercowboy/get-shit-done
/plugin install get-shit-done@get-shit-done
```

### Manual Installation

Clone the repository and tell Claude Code where to find it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done.git
claude --plugin-dir ./get-shit-done
```

Useful for development or testing modifications.

## Why I Built This

I'm a solo developer. I don't write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you're building. I'm not a 50-person software company. I don't want to play enterprise theater. I'm just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work _and_ verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That's what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.

## Installation

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc
```

That's it. Works on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

### Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc --global   # Install to ~/.claude/
npx get-shit-done-cc --local    # Install to ./.claude/
```

Use `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the interactive prompt.

Verify: `/gsd:help`

### Recommended: Skip Permissions Mode

GSD is designed for frictionless automation. Run Claude Code with:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

This is how GSD is intended to be used — stopping to approve `date` and `git commit` 50 times defeats the purpose.

If you prefer not to use that flag, add this to your project's `.claude/settings.json` to auto-approve GSD's commands:

<details>
<summary>Show settings.json permissions</summary>

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(date:*)",
      "Bash(echo:*)",
      "Bash(cat:*)",
      "Bash(ls:*)",
      "Bash(mkdir:*)",
      "Bash(wc:*)",
      "Bash(head:*)",
      "Bash(tail:*)",
      "Bash(sort:*)",
      "Bash(grep:*)",
      "Bash(tr:*)",
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git status:*)",
      "Bash(git log:*)",
      "Bash(git diff:*)",
      "Bash(git tag:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

## How It Works

### 1. Start with an idea

```
/gsd:new-project
```

The system asks questions. Keeps asking until it has everything — your goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases. You go back and forth until the idea is fully captured. Creates **PROJECT.md**.

### 2. Create roadmap

```
/gsd:create-roadmap     # Create phases and state tracking
```

Roadmap creation produces:

- **ROADMAP.md** - Phases from start to finish
- **STATE.md** - Living memory that persists across sessions

### 3. Plan and execute phases

```
/gsd:plan-phase 1      # System creates atomic task plans
/gsd:execute-plan      # Subagent implements autonomously
```

Each phase breaks into 2-3 atomic tasks. Each task runs in a fresh subagent context — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero degradation.

### 4. Ship and iterate

```
/gsd:complete-milestone   # Archive v1, prep for v2
/gsd:add-phase            # Append new work
/gsd:insert-phase 2       # Slip urgent work between phases
```

Ship your MVP in a day. Add features. Insert hotfixes. The system stays modular — you're never stuck.

## Existing Projects (Brownfield)

Already have code? Start here instead.

### 1. Map the codebase

```
/gsd:map-codebase
```

Spawns parallel agents to analyze your code. Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 documents:

- **STACK.md** — Languages, frameworks, dependencies
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — Patterns, layers, data flow
- **STRUCTURE.md** — Directory layout, where things live
- **CONVENTIONS.md** — Code style, naming patterns
- **TESTING.md** — Test framework, patterns
- **INTEGRATIONS.md** — External services, APIs
- **CONCERNS.md** — Tech debt, known issues, fragile areas

### 2. Initialize project

```
/gsd:new-project
```

Same as greenfield, but the system knows your codebase. Questions focus on what you're adding/changing, not starting from scratch.

### 3. Continue as normal

From here, it's the same: `/gsd:create-roadmap` → `/gsd:plan-phase` → `/gsd:execute-plan`

The codebase docs load automatically during planning. Claude knows your patterns, conventions, and where to put things.

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

Claude Code is incredibly powerful _if_ you give it the context it needs. Most people don't.

GSD handles it for you:

| File         | What it does                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded                          |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you're going, what's done                        |
| `STATE.md`   | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |
| `PLAN.md`    | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps     |
| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history      |
| `ISSUES.md`  | Deferred enhancements tracked across sessions          |

Size limits based on where Claude's quality degrades. Stay under, get consistent excellence.

### XML Prompt Formatting

Every plan is structured XML optimized for Claude:

```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Create login endpoint</name>
  <files>src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts</files>
  <action>
    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).
    Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  </action>
  <verify>curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie</verify>
  <done>Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401</done>
</task>
```

Precise instructions. No guessing. Verification built in.

### Subagent Execution

As Claude fills its context window, quality degrades. You've seen it: "Due to context limits, I'll be more concise now." That "concision" is code for cutting corners.

GSD prevents this. Each plan is maximum 3 tasks. Each plan runs in a fresh subagent — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage.

- Task 1: fresh context, full quality
- Task 2: fresh context, full quality
- Task 3: fresh context, full quality

No degradation. Walk away, come back to completed work.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion. Plans produce 2-4 commits total:

```bash
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing
lmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint
```

**Benefits:**
- Git bisect finds exact failing task
- Each task independently revertable
- Clear history for Claude in future sessions
- Better observability in AI-automated workflow

Every commit is surgical, traceable, and meaningful.

### Modular by Design

- Add phases to current milestone
- Insert urgent work between phases
- Complete milestones and start fresh
- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything

You're never locked in. The system adapts.

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not found after install?**
- Restart Claude Code to reload plugins
- Check `/plugins` to see installed plugins

**Commands showing as unavailable?**
- Verify plugin directory structure: should have `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Try `/gsd:help` - if it works, plugin is loaded correctly
